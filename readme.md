# Alura: Fokus Project

![Fokus Project](./imagens/gif_fokus_project.gif)

I am very happy that I completed this course! Building the Fokus Project gave me the opportunity to use various JavaScript methods to manipulate DOM elements.

## Project Overview

- **Background:** Purple and blue.
- **Message:** "Optimize your productivity, dive into what matters" at the top left.
- **Digital Art Bubble:** Located at the top right, it contains a person wearing headphones, facing away.
- **Timer Box:** Displaying a timer set to 25 minutes, with buttons for "focus," "short break," and "long break" above, and a "Music" switch below.
- **Logo:** The Fokus logo is centered at the top of the screen.

## Changing Elements

When you click on a button, such as "Short Break," the elements on the screen change accordingly:

- **Background:** Changes to dark green and blue.
- **Message:** Becomes "How about taking a breather? Take a short break!"
- **Bubble Image:** Shows a profile of a woman wearing headphones.
- **Timer:** Counts down from five minutes.

## Techniques Used

To achieve this, we utilized several techniques:

- `innerHTML`: Used to change text on the screen.
- `setAttribute`: Modified image paths.
- `classList`: Adjusted button classes and styles.
- `querySelector`: Selected elements.
- `EventList`: Listened for user interactions.
